# football-scoreboard-maker
A web-based football scoreboard for use as an overlay in OBS, Streamlabs, and similar streaming platforms. The scoreboard supports customizable team names, logos, colors, scores, and a game timer.

## Why 
I built this scoreboard for my hometown team, Kawkab Athletic Club Marrakech, to enhance their Facebook Live streams by adding a score and timer overlay. Dima Koukab!
